# Cloud Portfolio Website - Live Demo


Welcome to my Cloud Portfolio Website! This website was created to showcase my projects and skills, and it's live for you to explore right now.

**Project Duration:** July 2023 - September 2023

## Technologies Used
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Key Features
- **Responsive and Interactive:** The website is designed to work seamlessly on various devices and provides an interactive user experience.

- **CI/CD Pipeline:** I've implemented a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the testing and deployment of the website code. This pipeline is hosted on GitHub and utilizes AWS Amplify for deployment.

- **AWS Services:** Leveraging the power of AWS, I've used several services to host, secure, monitor, and optimize the website's performance. These services include:
  - [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/): For simplified hosting and CI/CD workflows.
  - [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/): Object storage for securely storing website assets.
  - [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/): Virtual servers for hosting dynamic content.
  - [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): Serverless compute for running code without provisioning servers.
  - [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/): Content delivery network (CDN) for fast content distribution.
  - [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/): Scalable DNS web service for routing traffic.
  - [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/): Monitoring and observability for the website's infrastructure.
  - [Synthetic Canaries](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/synthetics/): Automated testing to ensure website availability and performance.
